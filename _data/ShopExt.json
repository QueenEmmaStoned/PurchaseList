Of these, they have a particular affinity for the elusive truth behind shadow itself.\n\nChaoura have a marvelous utility organ that exploits phenomena manipulated by super-entities. This organ activates in darkness, bolstering its owner's abilities.\n\nMost attacks can't affect a chaoura under the cover of darkness. They can also evade perception and teleport through imaginary space when in darkness. In nighttime engagements, chaoura thus present an unprecedented threat. \n\nContact with hostile chaoura results in a phenomenon known as \"abyssal inflammation.\" This causes outbreaks of painful boils that each weaken the body separately. \n\nThe strengths of chaouran physiology don't come without costs, however. Any equipment with physical protection disrupts their ability to blend in with shadows. As such, they must rely on specialized weapons and apparel. Since the latter can't protect them, they're also vulnerable outside of darkness. \n\nDirect exposure to sunlight weakens chaoura by paralyzing their utility organs. As such, most chaoura exhibit sleep inversion.",

      "description": "The ancient prototypes of the ishmuti clade - the \"Simulacrum Race Eveliet\", or simply eveliet. Before the Creator perfected requeen-based mass production of ishmuti, the eveliet served as a proof of concept.\n\nCompared to their successors, an eveliet's genetic structure retains a far higher purity of super-entity data. They are thus highly unstable organisms. Their bodies couldn't even develop naturally from fetuses, so they were created in a near-adult state. For safety, they ordinarily reserve their full strength, thus differing little from baseline humans in ability. \n\nEveliet have two types of outer frames to support their unstable bodies. The first, \"K'lipa Repha'im\", is a kind of armor that stores auxiliary power. The second, \"Shahar Helev,\" are swords for collecting blood to power K'lipa Repha'im.\n\nGiven their purpose, the Creator only made a single eveliet. She was later revered by the ishmuti as the Creator's eldest daughter. However, she was unable to accept the transition of authority from the Creator to the qualeelan monarchy. Spearheading a rebellion, she used her accumulated blood to reduce the royal family's numbers by half. Nonetheless, her natural enemy, the idhale, managed to halt her advance. She met her eventual end to the great spear of the Divine Daughter's knight.\n\nThe eveliet known today represent an improved redesign by the Divine Daughter. Though less powerful than their originator, they are considerably more stable.\n\nEveliet can expend blood collected from other creatures to utilize additional power. Though blood is a finite resource, eveliet abilities have very short cooldown periods. They can thus be used repeatedly so long as blood remains.",

Planning for resurrection, it implanted its own cells in other machines as it crossed the stars. It fabricated false data about the idearn - a race that never existed - to elude the notice of Entelecheia. \n\nTucked away as they are, these mysteries would draw the attention of those hungry for power and knowledge.

Thus, the Nearmare Aradia never recognized the authority of the Royals.\n\nWhen the Creator fell, the Nearmare Aradia began wielding their powers freely. In time, this gave rise to terrible calamities across various worlds. The three major ishmutian factions thus came together to prevent further disasters. They debated possible plans of action, even considering total extermination. But in the end, they decided on mercy, sealing away the Nearmare Aradia in special coffins.\n\nNearmare Aradia removed from their coffins tend to behave as reasonable, intellectual people. Excelling in research and medicine, they often become well-respected members of their societies. Yet none can grasp their true nature, nor understand what lies in their hearts. Moreover, their devilish beauty will threaten to tear their peers' relationships apart.\n\nNearmare Aradia are capable of a terrifying summoning act termed the \"Forbidden Summon.\" Be sure the vicinity is clear of friendly people and animals before using it.",

Much like their predecessors, neclose can summon ethereal entities to fight for them.\n\nThe neclose also enjoy mutualism with a unique strain of psychically-attuned bacteria. These bacteria bolster the neclose's combat lethality and support all their bodily systems. The bacteria are also capable of affecting their host's psyche and thrive on a diet of flesh. As a result, neclose develop positive associations with meat and corpses of any kind.\n\nBesides spreading disease to organics, neclosian attacks are capable of disabling mechanoids. Moreover, neclose tend to be long-lived and their bacterial mutualism makes them disease-resistant. Unfortunately, neclose make poor laborers, as they lack dexterity and hold disdain for non-combat tasks. That lack of dexterity also means they are entirely incapable of using weapons. Finally, the large, tentacled bodies of the neclose limit their mobility.",

Characterized by their pure white wings and the diverse auras that crown their heads, they are often mistaken for angels and have been worshipped by many humans.\n\n      In the distant past, the Milira were strong and warlike. They seemed to be born for battle, relying on their innate combat instincts and superior physical capabilities. They excelled at using swift and fierce close combat, as well as devastating spells to shatter their enemies, thus dominating their realm.\n      \n      However, after vanquishing all their formidable foes, the Milira gradually lost the meaning of battle. The race needed to find a new purpose for existence. But with their exceedingly long lifespans, the Milira's interest in anything could be worn away by the passage of time, leaving only the unfathomable sea of knowledge that continually drew them to explore.\n      \n      Gradually, the Milira ceased to yearn for battle and began to pursue knowledge. They collected languages and texts from various races, observed every corner of the world; built floating cities, and established libraries to store their accumulating wisdom. Over time, the combat skills of the Milira were buried deep in the collective memory, covered by layer upon layer of fertile soil called knowledge.\n      \n      The Milira had a long period of friendly relations with humans and occasionally guided them in the development of science and technology. However, after a certain incident, the Milira became enemies with humans, and the clouds of war gradually enveloped everyone. A conflict seemed inevitable...",

      "description": "The ishmutian Creator's final Elite race - the Idhale Avonruach. Even today, details about their kind remain shrouded in mystery. Records that exist revolve around a great war in the ishmuti clade's ancient past. The only tale widely known to the clade describes the Avonruach as \"those who destroyed the 'Star-Crossing Bird.'\" \n\nAfter the war, the Avonruach vanished without a trace. Given the lack of sightings, most concluded that they had gone extinct. Yet in recent years, they've started to appear again. They now organize regular assaults against powerful independent settlements. This continues even against the orders of the Entelechian Royal Bloods.\n\nAs the Creator's final creation, their abilities surpass even those of the Royals. They have the power to singlehandedly defeat an army and even defy death. Upon perishing, they shortly resurrect even stronger than they were before.\n\nLike their common kin, an Avonruach's body can nullify attacks. But in exchange for greater offensive performance, this ability is imperfect. It provides full protection against melee attacks, yet only partial protection for ranged attacks.\n\n\nThe Spirits of Iniquity did indeed destroy the Bird. But something was missing inside its corpse. \n\nOn that day, they knew that the seeds of the next calamity had already been sown...",

They are natural born warriors originally created as living bioweapons.\n\nXenoorca inherit the strong muscles and tough skin of certain Earth marine mammals. Their insulated bodies have a high metabolic rate, causing them to thrive in the cold but suffer in the heat. These factors combine to make the xenoorca a race of ravenous, active huntresses. Like their sister races, the xenoorca also suffer from weak immune systems.\n\nReflecting their intended purpose, xenoorca tend to be cunning and brutal. Most enjoy the thrill of a hunt and offer their quarry no mercy. Still, some usual or adaptive individuals can learn to live in mixed-race societies. Such communities come to discover a cheerful yet mischievous side of xenoorcan nature.",

Their special abilities pertain to the deep ocean. They also exhibit remarkable hand-to-hand combat prowess, enhanced by their vitality and regeneration.\n\nAfter a great conflict, the Hadalnoia led the xenoorcan populace into a coup d'état against the ishmutian state. This, along with a grave charge of \"Deicide,\" led to their banishment. Even in exile, they perpetrated massacres across space. It's thought that the Orcinus Brigade trace their origins from these genocides.\n\nThrough the years, Hadalnoia have continued acting as commanders for the Orcinus Brigade. Sometimes they're even spotted on the battlefield, leading the charge against powerful settlements. For their cruelty, Hadalnoia are often called by the title of \"Abyssal Mistresses.\"\n\nContact with hostile Hadalnoia causes immobilization from the weight of the deep sea. As such, it's best to avoid one-on-one confrontations. If all else fails, focus on eliminating a Hadalnoia's subordinates to force a retreat. \n\nThe Hadalnoia were once the Creator's personal guards, proud and content. It remains unknown why they've been reduced to mere bandits. Yet whispered rumors persist of their quiet, selective killing of littluna.",

They manage the so-called \"Prison Planet Melah,\" a planetary neighbor to Canaan. \n\nMelah is a cold world dedicated to the imprisonment of \"sinners\" captured by Canaan and their allies. As such, zoichor were created with an innate affinity for guard work and freezing temperatures.\n\nZoichor development involved special data gathered by the chaoura on \"Infernal Entities.\" To control their hellish powers, zoichorian design incorporates eveliet and Dunamis genes alike. As inheritors of the Divine Daughter's and thus the Creator's genes, some consider the zoichor to be his authentic descendants. However, their frightening power makes them a potential liability. Zoichor are thus non-reproductive by design, produced only in specialized bioenginerring plants.\n\nZoichor are serious and professional by nature, apathetic even when punishing their prisoners. This, alongside Melah's general atmosphere, has earned them a frightening reptuation. Even among ishmuti, many consider zoichor \"super scary,\" \"kinda freaky,\" and \"probably into sadism.\"\n\nThe chaoura, an isolationist race by nature, are close with the zoichor alone. Whispered rumors abound chaouran headquarters tucked away in the zoichorian domain of Melah.",
